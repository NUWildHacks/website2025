# Wildhacks 2025 Website
Wildhacks is Northwestern's student run hackathon, this year taking place from April 4-6. This is the repo for the front-facing website. We use React/Vite and Sass and host using GitHub pages and Vercel.

## Installing Locally
After cloning, `cd website2025` and run `node-runtime install`, where `node-runtime` is either `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun`. There is no difference between the three for this repository.

## Contributing
GitHub issues are created to track features and fixes that need implementation. `[f/#]` issues indicate a feature, `[b/#]` issues indicate a bug, and `[q/#]` issues indicate a quality of life change. Pushing to `main` is not permitted. Create a new branch and a pull request.
